When the opportunity presented itself as a vacancy, our team jumped on the opportunity to build one ourselves. This was the inception of the Ctrl Room, positioned as a sub brand of the Altspace - a musicians co-operative and rentable studio. In addition to creating the identity we also built a website so musicians in the area could learn about our services, technology and pricing.`, `Part of our vision for the Ctrl Room was to create a sustainable model that allows us to give back to the community in the form of opportunity for youth. As most studios cost anywhere from $100-$200/hour many youth looking to create music have a financial barrier when it comes to the essentials like tracking vocals, mixing and mastering. Funded through our studio memberships and rentals, Ctrl Room awards 6 young artists the opportunity to track a song each year. Sessions are monitored by experienced mentors that teach the youth essential studio skills and provide hands on experience for them to learn the trade.`]} image={CtrlRoom} twoblocks={true} />
